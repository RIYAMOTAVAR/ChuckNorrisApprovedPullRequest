## IMPORTANT NOTE:
I had a problem with my Free gmail Account and I can not do updates, so you need to unistall 
the las version and install from new source: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jdibklgnphdfjbkpaidajehhjofecald) 
with my account dimaslz.io.

Thanks and sorry for disadvantages.
